### Pros of using python as backend
- Instead of doing it like https://www.unix.com/unix-for-dummies-questions-and-answers/161774-sin-cos-awk.html , prompt operation and operand one by one, we do it the way that a productive command-line calculator needs to be, able to chain operands, etc, do more than one operation after choosing an operation type, no need so clunky have to choose operation again everytime

- floating point arithmetic is handled, no need go through hassle of doing it with `bc -l`
